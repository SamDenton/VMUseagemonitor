SETUP:
-First, map the shared folder to a network drive.  In file explorer on 'this PC', click 'computer' at the top, and click map network drive
-Pick a drive letter EG 'V' and paste the shared folder into the directory
-Then create a shortcut and copy it to desktop
-If you use drive letter V, you can copy the existing shortcut

USAGE:
-Run 'VM_Manager.bat' to open program
-If Server List file gets messed up there is a backup of original
-There is only basic input validation on form so avoid special chars for now
-Let me (Sam De) know if you find issues so I can fix, including spelling mistakes, which are many...

ADD NEW VMs:
-To add a new server to this tool, click the add button at the bottom of the server list and use the UI to enter details
-The VM will need group pilocy setting so it auto-logs of disconnected users after 5 mins, and idle after an hour
-VM's registary needs to be configured to allow remote RPC:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server

-and change AllowRemoteRPC from 0 to the 1

TODO LIST:
-**Now JS is all on one file, a lot of my code is redundent so need to re-write.  I dont need to hack variable sharing via temp files if its all on one page...........**
-Need some way to check serverList.txt is formatted correctly
-Could add a check so that a server must return a positive qwinsta query before it can be added to list (wont work for connections where username and password is unknown, or policy blocks RPC like web server)
-Add functionality to management page, such as updating username and password
-Need to improve input validation to protect against code injection.  Should at least escape special chars
-Decide whether to keep the 2 example VMs hard coded or make them part of external file
-Could look at combining management page with connection page, not really a reason to have 2 pages (tho it makes the code a lot easier, as updating the temp files would be a pain)
-If I want to include automatic sign on for secure connections, like the web server, I need to encrypt the password storage
-My Functions are mostly written out of order.  JS is asynchronous so works fine but hard to read.
-If I change findstr to JS, I can have to look for 'active' next to session name, and would not need session to end when disconnected 
-Should change the alert when connecting to VM, either remove it or add a cancel option
-Look at changing file extentions to .hta rather than .bat, might solve some of my issues with cmd window being active
-Add a feature to list customers and connect to correct COM server!
-At some point, I need to decide on terminology.  Is this program for connecting to VM's or remote systems or servers?  Maybe should just call them 'Connections'?
-My main table could be formatted better so it looks clean on different monitor sizes
-Add a feedback button? :S

BUG LIST:
-Issue if 2 people loading at same time.  Fine to start new instance once first is fully loaded.  Could implement a loading queue? Or save temp- path to ProgramData?
-Loading spiner vibrates slightly
-Slight pause when first opening might be due to loading in bootstrap components it does not need.  Should look at minifying this or making a custom library

VERSION NOTES:
V2 Notes:  
-I have added visual feedback when page is refreshing.
-Have removed some redundent code.

V3 Notes:
-Have added some error checking to the QWINSTA query so program knows when VM is offline

V4 Notes:
-Have changed a lot of code to allow table to update to VMList length dynamically
-Have changed how VM's are stored so they are now picked up from external file

V5 Notes:
-Added dynamic VM name so it pulls from file
-Have created a basic UI for adding new VMs
-Currently have no input checks so would be very easy to inject code.  Need to add proper form checks

V6 Notes:
-Added some basic input validation, so all boxes need filling and IP address must be valid
-Added a table to show the new VMs added in that session
-Added the ability to remove VMs from file.  Seems pretty robust, not yet been able to break it
-Made add VM page into a VM management UI

V7 Notes
-Have split qwinsta batch so each VM is queried at same time.  Speeds up loading considerably.  This involved a lot of code change so need to look for bugs
-Fixed bug when trying to remove example VMs
-General code cleanup and refactoring (no code outside of functions etc)
-Added comments to every part of code

V8 Notes
-Have removed the VMList array containing the IP addresses as it was duplicating data from main VMDetail array.  This removed a lot of code syncing the 2 arrays
-Have swapped the loading screen over to bootstrap to make it more consistant with rest of UI

V9 Notes
-Might have solved bug where some loading responces are missed by giving each VM its own loading file
-Have swapped all temp files over to user %tmp% file to allow multiple users on app server
-Cleaned up some hacky code, added comments, removed old commented code, removed unnecessary vars, improved indentation, improved code style consistancy 
-Changed lable for manage VM button

V10 Notes
-**Have moved almost all JS to a single file being referenced by the hta's**
-Have removed the table showing newly added VM's.  Think this looks better but not yet sure
-Added a prompt to use space for non test VM connecitons.  Looks a bit janky atm
-Reverted changes to main batch logic to implement a single JS file.  Will look to move logic to JS in V11
-(Fixed):"-Look at bug causing addVm page to appear behind the CMD window that opened it"
-(fixed):"-Look into bug where loading file only contains some responces.  Issue with 4 scripts trying to write to same file at once?"

V11 Notes:
-Most logic moved from batch to JS
-Re-written logic to show all user sessions and whether they are active, disconnected or Idle
-Fixed refresh spinner
-Improved logic for making connection
-Added an auto-refresh, currently set to 5 mins
-Fixed a bug causing program to refresh constantly in a progressivly faster loop.  Was using setInterval instead of setTimeout 
-Added some explainer text to addVM screen.
-(Fixed) -Look into bug causing infinate loop when checking loaded.txt (I know what causes the loop, I dont know how its working without the line that causes it!!!)
-(Fixed I think) -Look into bug where it loads instantly without querying VMs.  Think I just need to play with the delay before it looks at the loaded files
-Lots of improvements to readability of code
-Fixed a few minor things like program restarting instead of refreshing, clearing files it needed still when moving to addVM page and the actual connection logic was badly written so sometimes failed
-Added some tooltips and explainers
-Changed the mesages for whether conneciton is available
